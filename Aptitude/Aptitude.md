### **1. Number Series**
Series of the number will be given we need to find the next number
ex: 1,23,234,? find the pattern, what will be the next number

To solve this type of question we go through below list of option
check weather,
1. Addition/subtraction of consecutive number form a patter
2. even number or odd number form the patter
3. there is pattern by dividing the number or multiplying the number
4. the power to the certain number forms the pattern
5. combination of above four forms a pattern
6. check pattern in prime number, fibonacci number
7. Random patter combination of all

### **2. Analogy and odd man out**
It is the comparison between the like features of two objects

``` 
ex: 
1. A:B::C:D (45:41::37:__)
first number 45 -> 4^2 + 5^2 = 41(second number)
therefore, 3^2 + 7^2 = 9+ 49 = 58 (answer)
```
``` 
2. CLASS:54::BDLT:___

Answer:
Convert character to number (ex: A to 1 ... z to 26)
so C-3, L-12, A-1, 2-19
    3+12+1+19+19 = 54
similarly
B-2, D-4, L-12, T-20
    2+4+12+20 = 38
```

#### **1. Simplification**
 Here the equation is given and ask you to solve the equation or simply the equation to find the value (ex: X);

#### **2. LCM/HCF**
**LCM** is Least Common Multiple. It is also known as the LCD(least Common divisor).
Consider we need to find LCM of 8,15
To find the LCM we need to list the multiples of 8 and 5

8-> 8, 16, 24, 32, **40**, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80,...

5-> 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, **40**, 50,...

You can see that the 40 is the lest number that can dived by 8 and 5.

Lets find the LCM fro 20, 16
20-> 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, **160**, 180,...
16-> 16,32,48,64,80,96,112,128,144,**160**,176,...

<details><summary>2. Find the smallest number which when divided by 12,15,18,60 leaves a remainder of 5 in each case.</summary><br/>

(Here % is considered as the operator that produce the remainder of the two number ex: remainder of 6/5 is 1, which is mentioned as 6%5=1)
Given we need to find the number N, that produce
N%12=5, N%15=5, N%18=5, N%60 =5.

To do so if we find the LCM, (which all the number is divisible) that gives the remainder of 0.
so if we add LCM with 5, then we get the remainder of 5.

since, LCM(12,15,18,60)=180

so the ans will be LCM+5=185.

185%12=5, 185%15=5, 185%18=5, 185%60 =5.

**HCF** (Highest common Factor) or GCD (Great Common Divisor)
suppose if two number are given, Highest number that divides the given number is known as the HCF
ex: to find HCF of 60,75
60<-- 30, 20, **15**, 12, 10, 5, 3, 2
75<-- 25, **15**, 5

60%X=0, where x= 30, 20, 15, 12, 10, 5,3,2
75%Y=0, where Y=25,15,5

you can see that 15 is the highest number, that can divide both 60 and 75.

Now we understand what is HCF,
Let see the other simple method.

#### **3. Divisibility Rule**
ex: if 853 is divisible by 2 or not? **Ans: No**

Number | Divisibility Rule | Example
:-:|-|-
2 | Last digit must be even | 14/2 is divisible , 15/2 is not
3 | if sum of digits is multiple of 3| 853/3, 8+5+3=16 (16 is divisible by 3) so 853 is divisible by 3
4 |last two digit of the number is multiple of 4 | 819764 (last two digit is 64, 64 is the multiple of 4, so 819764 is the multiple of 4)
5 | last digit must be 5 or 0| 85,90 are multiple of 5
6 | number is divisible by 2 and 3| 186 is divisible by 2 and 3, so it is multiple of 6
8 | last 3 digit is divisible by 8 | 815762 (762 is divisible of 8), so the given number is divisible of 8
9 | Sum of digit should be a divisible of 9 | 7164 is divisible by 9 because 7+1+6+4=18, which is divisible by 9
11 | difference in sum of the number at alternate place is 0 or multiple of 11 | 18425671, (1+4+5+7)-(8+2+6+1)=0. so, the given number is the multiple of 11
7 | given number is ,separated to 3 digits and there difference between them will be the multiple of 7 | <ul><li>ex1: 891765, 891-765=126, Which is divisible by 7</li><li>875`431`297`818`, (874+297)-(431818)= 77 which is a divisible of 7.</li><li>81764, 081-764=683, not divisible by 7</ul>
13 | same as 7 but the difference number should be multiple of 13 instead of 7  | 714025, 714-025=689 which is the divisible of 13
10 | The last digit of the number should be 0 | 890 which is divisible by 10.

#### **Cyclicity of unit digit of a number**
<sub>Note: unit digit is the last digit in the number. in the number 87654`1`, 1 is the number in the unit place</sub> 
Number | condition | Example
:-:|-|-
2 | unit number of $2^1$, $2^2$, $2^3$, $2^4$ us 2,4,8,6.<ol><li>If the number is of $2^{4k+1}$ then the unit place is 2</li><li>If the number is of $2^{4k+2}$ then the unit place is 4</li><li>If the number is of $2^{4k+3}$ then the unit place is 8</li><li>If the number is of $2^{4k+4}$ then the unit place is 6</li> | $2^4$ is 16, which has the 6 as the number in unit place
3 | Similary for 3, the unit place of first four power is 3,9,7,1<ol><li>If the number is of $3^{4k+1}$ then the unit place is 3</li><li>If the number is of $3^{4k+2}$ then the unit place is 9</li><li>If the number is of $3^{4k+3}$ then the unit place is 7</li><li>If the number is of $3^{4k+4}$ then the unit place is 1</li> | $3^4$ is 81, which has the unit place of 1.
4 | <ul><li>if $4^{2k+1}$, the unit digit of the answer is 4</li><li>if $4^{2k}$, the unit digit of the answer is 6</li></ul> | $4^3$ is 6`4`, which as the 4 in the unit place. similarly $4^4$ is 25`6` with unit number of 6.
5 | $5^n$ always has the unit place of 5. | $5^2$ is 2`5`, 5 is the unit place
6 | $6^n$ always has the unit place of 6. | $6^2^ is 3`6`, 6 is the unit place
7 | unit place of $7^1,7^2,7^3,7^4$ is7,9,3,1 respectively and this pattern forms repetatively. use the below condition<br/><ol><li>If the number is $7^{4K+1}$ then unit place is 7</li><li>If the number is $7^{4K+2}$ then unit place is 9</li><li>If the number is $7^{4K+3}$ then unit place is 3</li><li>If the number is $7^{4K+4}$ then unit place is 1</li></ol> | <ul><li> $7^3$ is 343, unit place is 3</li><li>$7^4$ is 2401, unit place has 1</li></ul>
8 | similarly for 8, <ol><li>$8^{4k+1}$ unit place will be 8</li><li>$8^{4k+2}$ unit place will be 4</li><li>$8^{4k+3}$ unit place will be 2</li><li>$8^{4k+4}$ unit place will be 6</li></ol> | $8^2$ will be 64, 4 is in unit place
9 | for 9, if the number $9^{2K+1}$, the unit place will be 9, else if $9^(2k+2), the unit place will be 1. | ex: $9^2$ will be 81, the unit place will be 1.


#### **Remainder**
if we divide 17/5, 2 will be the remainder
![remainder](img/remainder.png)

from the above example we can say $17=5*3+2$  
since, Dividend = Divisor*Quotient + Remainder

**Addition Property of Remainder**   
<mark>
Remainder ($\frac{A+B}{D}$)=Remainder($\frac{A}{D}$)+Remainder($\frac{B}{D}$)
</mark>  
If the sum of remainder is greater than or equal to D, then again the remainder is take for the sum.
ex:  
Assume remainder of 17, 16, 41 divided by 3 will be 2, 1, 2 respectively.
therefore,  
Remainder ($\frac{17+16+41}{3}$)=Remainder($\frac{17}{3}$)+Remainder($\frac{16}{3}$)+Remainder($\frac{41}{3}$)
$  
=2+1+2         
=5
$ 
The sum is 5 which is greater than D(here D>=3). 
$Remainder(\frac{5}{3})$ is 2.
so, 2 is the answer.

**Multiplication Property of Remainder**  
<mark>
Remainder($\frac{A*B}{D}$)=Remainder($\frac{A}D$)\*Remainder($\frac{B}D$), similarly if the answer is greater than or equal to D, Then again remainder should be taken
</mark>   
ex:  
Remainder($\frac{137*151*163}{5}$)=Remainder($\frac{137}{5}$)+Remainder($\frac{151}{5}$)+Remainder($\frac{163}{5}$) 
= 2*1*3
= 6
which is greater than D (D=5)
so the remainder of(6/5)=1
so the answer will be 1.

#### **Negative Remainder**
Normal remainder is 17 = 5\*3 + 2;  
Negative Remainder is 17 = 5\*4 - 3;  
We can continue the above as,  
17=5\*2+7;
17=5\*5-8;
if we continue the remainder could get increase for normal remainder, and decrease for Negative remainder by D(here, D=5);
=remainder&plusmn;kD, Where k=1,2,3...
