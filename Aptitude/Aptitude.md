## 1. Reasoning
### 1. Number Series
Series of the number will be given we need to find the next number
ex: 1,23,234,? find the pattern, what will be the next number

To solve this type of question we go through below list of option
check weather,
1. Addition/subraction of consequtive number form a patter
2. even number or odd number form the patter
3. there is pattern by dividing the number or multiplying the number
4. the power to the certain number forms the pattern
5. combination of above four forms a pattern
6. check pattern in prime number, fibinocci number
7. Random patter combination of all

### 2. Analogy and odd man out
It is the comparison between the like features of two objects
``` 
    ex: 
    1. A:B::C:D (45:41::37:__)
    first number 45 -> 4^2 + 5^2 = 41(second number)
    therefore, 3^2 + 7^2 = 9+ 49 = 58 (answer)
```
``` 
    2. CLASS:54::BDLT:___
    
    Answer:
    Convert character to number (ex: A to 1 ... z to 26)
    so C-3, L-12, A-1, 2-19
        3+12+1+19+19 = 54
    similarly
    B-2, D-4, L-12, 20
        2+4+12+20 = 38
```
