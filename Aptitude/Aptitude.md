## **1. Reasoning**
### **1. Number Series**
Series of the number will be given we need to find the next number
ex: 1,23,234,? find the pattern, what will be the next number

To solve this type of question we go through below list of option
check weather,
1. Addition/subraction of consequtive number form a patter
2. even number or odd number form the patter
3. there is pattern by dividing the number or multiplying the number
4. the power to the certain number forms the pattern
5. combination of above four forms a pattern
6. check pattern in prime number, fibinocci number
7. Random patter combination of all

### **2. Analogy and odd man out**
It is the comparison between the like features of two objects

``` 
ex: 
1. A:B::C:D (45:41::37:__)
first number 45 -> 4^2 + 5^2 = 41(second number)
therefore, 3^2 + 7^2 = 9+ 49 = 58 (answer)
```
``` 
2. CLASS:54::BDLT:___

Answer:
Convert character to number (ex: A to 1 ... z to 26)
so C-3, L-12, A-1, 2-19
    3+12+1+19+19 = 54
similarly
B-2, D-4, L-12, T-20
    2+4+12+20 = 38
```
It can be classified into:
1. knowladge based Analogy
2. Alphabet based Analogy
3. Number based Analogy

#### **1. Knowledge Based Analogy**
```
1. Ashes:Cricket:: Grand Slam: _______

(for this type of question general Knowladge is used)

Ashes is the test cricket series played between England and Australia,
Grand Slam in tennis is the achievement of winning all four major championships in a calendar year.

2. Cat:Kitten:: Horse:____
ans: Pony
```
#### **2. Alphabet Based Analogy**
```
1. WATCH:XCWGM::MUSIC:____

---
Consider below
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
---

you can see X is next to W,
C is one letter away from A,
W is two letter away from T,
G is three letter away from C,
M is four letter away from H.

In the above you can notice that there is an increase in lettery away from the given letters.

using this methodology we can find
MUSIC:NWVMH
NWVMH is the answer

2. Y:E::__:D

Y is 25th, E is 5th position in the alphabet seriest

5^2 = 25;

similay,
D is 4th position in Alphabet series.

4^2 =16 
P is the 16th posistion in the alphabet series.
answer: P
```

#### **3. Number based analogy**
```
1. 7:729::10:___

(7 + 2)^3 =729 (this forms 729)

similarly for 10,
(10+2)^3=1728 (this forms 1728)

answer: 1728

2. 8:1000::7:____
options: a) 110, b) 111, c) 1011, d) 1111

from the above option you can understand that this is a binary system based problem.

Binary value of 8 is 1000;

similarly, binary value of 7 is 111;

so the answer is 111
