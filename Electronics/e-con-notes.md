## Basic circuit elements
1. Resisor
1. Inductor
1. Capacitor

### Resistor
Property of material to oppose the flow of electrons through the material

1. $R=\frac{\rho l}{A}$

    $\rho$ --> Resistivity\
    l --> Lenght of the conductor\
    A --> Area of cross section

1. Accroding to ohms law, $V=IR$ Watts

1. Power ansprned of by resistor $P=VI=I^2 R$
1. Energy lost in the resistance in form of heat $E=I^2Rt$ Joules

- Linear device
- ohms law, V=IR
- before using restitor know, Actual Resistance, power rating, resistor tolerance, thermal coefficient,

### Inductance
Property of material which opposes any change of magnitude or direction of current passing through the conductor. Energy stored in the inductor is in the form of magnetic field. unit is henry

1. Voltage of the inductor is $V=L\frac{di}{dt}$
1. Power = P=VI=$P=Li\frac{di}{dt}$ watts
1. Energy stored $E=\frac{1}{2}Li^2$ Joules
1. Inductive Reactance = $X_L = 2\pi fL$

Here voltage is leading current in phasor diagram by 90&deg;

### Capacitance
Capacbility of element to store electric charge within it. unit is Farad

1. Current inside capacitor is $I=C\frac{dV_c}{dt}$ Amphere
1. Power $P=VI=VC\frac{dV_c}{dt}$ Watts
1. Energy $E=\frac{1}{2}CV^2$ Joules
1. Capacitance $C=\frac{\epsilon A}{d}$, where $\epsilon$ is permittivity, d is distanc between plates, A is area of plates
1. Capacitance $C=\frac{Q}{V}$, Q is charge
1. Capacitive reactance, $X_C=\frac{1}{2\pi fC}$ $\Omega$

Here Current is leading voltage in phasor diagram by 90&deg;
