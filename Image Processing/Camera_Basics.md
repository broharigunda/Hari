# Camera
## Defination
A device which captures the ambient light and converts it to an image or video. The term camera comes from the word camera obscura (Latin for "dark chamber"), an early mechanism for projecting images.
Types –  
- Analog Cameras
- Digital Cameras

### Analog Cameras
Analog cameras use films which are exposed for a period defined by opening of the shutter to produce images.

<sub> **APERTURE**  
Aperture = focal Length / diaprame size  
example ( f/1.4, f/2.8, f/5.6, f/16 )  
f/1.4  -> More light, less depth of field ( backgroud blur with clear subject )  
.  
.  
f/16   -> Less Light, more depth of field ( clear background with clear subject )  \

it works similar to the working of human eye pupils

<sub> **ISO**  
[ ISO DEF. Camera ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBxsCNF5ims)

Iso deside the light sensitivity of the sensor...  
If it is low, sensor will be less sensitive to the light and vise versa.  

most common ISO values are 100 200 400 800 1600 3000

we can use it whith sutter speed to take the image in low light... condition... etc...
